To fully utilize case information, high-quality annotation is essential. While LLMs are highly useful for annotation, it can be challenging to determine whether the appropriate terms exist within the ontology being used. In this project, we will use LLMs to annotate text extracted from case reports with HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology). To evaluate and refine the quality of these annotations, we will incorporate visualization tools that allow physicians and medical students to easily understand and verify the HPO terms. Through this approach, we aim to assess whether the annotation of case information can be streamlined, while also engaging in discussions with specialists to identify any missing terms in the HPO.
